This package provides the exact same completions in ~shell-mode~ as you get in a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Terminal-emulator.html][terminal emulator]] with the =TAB= key. This means that completions are always accurate and synchronized with your current directory and shell environment. This also means that subshell completion works correctly.

Currently this has been tested in

- bash
- csh
- zsh
- sqlite

* Setup steps
**  Emacs setup
Install from Melpa with ~M-x package-install~.

This project contains two completion packages, ~native-complete~ for basic auto-complete completion and ~company-native-complete~ for [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]]. Choose one.

*** If using default (built-in) completion
For users of the built-in auto-complete package, ~native-complete~ provides ~native-complete-at-point~ which is a "completion at point function" (capf) and can be enabled by adding it to ~completion-at-point-functions~ in a shell buffer.

*** If using company mode
For users of the add-on company package ~company-native-complete~ provides a function of the same name which is an asynchronous backend for the company completion framework. It is enabled by adding it as a [[https://company-mode.github.io/manual/Backends.html#Backends][company backend]]. For example, you could add the following to your init file.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-native-complete)
#+end_src

*** Customize the prompt regex
You need to set the variable ~comint-prompt-regex~ to a regex that will match your shell prompt. The following is a good default for ~bash~, ~zsh~, and ~csh~.
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook (lambda () (setq comint-prompt-regex "^.+[$%>] ")))
#+end_src

** shell setup
*** bash
Run ~native-complete-setup-bash~ in Emacs /before/ you load your first shell. Add this to your emacs configuration file.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'shell
    (native-complete-setup-bash))
#+END_SRC

If the ~HISTCONTROL~ environment variable is not set to ~ignorespace~ or ~ignoreboth~
you will get a lot of garbage in your shell history. We also need to disable bracketed-paste. Add these to your ~.bashrc~ file.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
  bind 'set enable-bracketed-paste off'
#+END_SRC

*** csh
Make sure editing is enabled.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  set edit
#+END_SRC

** Check the config
Once the above steps are complete, run ~native-complete-check-config~ in a shell buffer to check for common problems. If it reports success you should be good to go.
** Advanced setup
For most users this package should work out the box after the above steps. However if you are using an unusual shell or are invoking subshells that are a different type then your main shell, you may need add some additional configuration.

Native complete look at the shell prompt or process name to determine which completion style to use. A completion style is the key used to get the candidates from the native shell. Most shells support ~<tab>~ , but some shells won't give you all the candidates consistently without using a different style (key sequence). There are currently the following completion styles:

- bash ::   ~M-*~
- zsh ::  ~C-D~
- tab ::  ~<tab>~
- sqlite :: =<tab> <tab>=

Which completion style to use is determined by the ~shell-file-name~, which is the executable that is used to start your shell. If the style can't be determined from that, or if you use subshells that are a different type, you can use ~native-complete-style-regex-alist~. This variable is a alist of ~(prompt-regex . style)~ pairs. If the prompt of the current shell matches ~prompt-regex~ then the corresponding ~style~ will be used. For example, if your prompt is of the form ~user>~ and your shell is bash, you could you the following setting to configure that.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq native-complete-style-regex-alist '(("[a-z]+> " . bash)))
#+END_SRC

To test what completion style your shell is using, call ~native-complete-check-config~ from a shell buffer. The default completion style is ~tab~.

You can add your own completion styles by adding to ~native-complete-style-suffix-alist~. This is an alist of ~(style . completion-suffix)~ pairs. If you discover a new completion style that would be generally applicable, opening a PR would be appreciated. This will improve the supported shells of ~native-complete~ out of the box.

~native-complete-exclude-regex~ is a regular expression that is used to match potential candidates that should not appear in the final completion list.

*** prompt components in completion list
 if you encouter an issue where parts of your shell prompt are showing up as completion candidates you can add a function to ~comint-redirect-filter-functions~ to remove the prompt line from the process output. See the doc string of that variable for more details.
